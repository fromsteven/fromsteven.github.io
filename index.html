	<p>I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to be a terrible friend (especially near the end of our friendship). I'm glad you found Dylan and I really hope you're happy. Thanks for being my friend even though I was extremely toxic to you. 
		I can't believed you stuck with me for three years even though I deeply hurted you which I was naive about. I guess I couldn't fathom the pain you went through until now by trying to reflect all the bad memories we had together. 
		If you don't believe in youself then believe in that special person that believes in you. Sorry for hurting your self-esteem. </p>
